## Analysis Parameters

1. Map 1: The Air District would like to develop a GIS map similar to the map developed in MTC’s 2019 Plan for Providing Special Language Services to LEP Populations that utilizes most recently available census data (see page 14: https://mtc.ca.gov/sites/default/files/MTC_2019_Plan_for_Providing_Special_Language_Services_to_LEP_Population_-_Final.pdf). 
2. Maps 2-6: In addition, like in MTC’s report, the Air District would like to develop maps like that of A-1 through A-6 in the appendix, utilizing most recently available census data (see Appendix A in the MTC report linked above).
