| Census Bureau Urbanized Area or   Urbanized Cluster        | urban_area       | The Census Bureau’s urban-rural classification is fundamentally a delineation of geographical areas, identifying both individual urban areas and the rural areas of the   nation.The Census Bureau’s urban areas represent densely developed territory, and encompass residential, commercial, and other non-residential urban land uses.            For the 2010 Census, an urban area will comprise a densely settled core of   census tracts and/or census blocks that meet minimum population density   requirements, along with adjacent territory containing non-residential urban land uses as well as territory with low population density included to link outlying densely settled territory with the densely settled core. To qualify as an urban area, the territory identified according to criteria must encompass at least 2,500 people, at least 1,500 of which reside outside institutional group quarters. The Census Bureau identifies two types of urban areas:            - Urbanized Areas (UAs) of 50,000 or more people;      - Urban Clusters (UCs) of at least 2,500 and less than 50,000 people.      “Rural” encompasses all population, housing, and territory not included   within an urban area.| 2A               | United States Census Bureau                                          | Centroid Within   | Clip to Bay Area 2019 Census Tiger County boundaries  |
| Coastal Zone Boundary                                      | coastal_zone     | Following its establishment by   voter initiative in 1972, the California Coastal Commission (Coastal   Commission) was made permanent by the Legislature through the adoption of the   California Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act).            In partnership with coastal cities and counties, The Coastal Commission   plans and regulates the use of land and water in the coastal zone.   Development activities, which are broadly defined by the Coastal Act to   include (among others) construction of buildings, divisions of land, and   activities that change the intensity of use of land or public access to   coastal waters, within the Coastal Zone Boundary (CZB) generally require a   coastal permit from either the Coastal Commission or the local   government.            The Coastal Act includes specific policies that address issues such as   shoreline public access and recreation, lower cost visitor accommodations,   terrestrial and marine habitat protection, visual resources, landform   alteration, agricultural lands, commercial fisheries, industrial uses, water   quality, offshore oil and gas development, transportation, development   design, power plants, ports, and public works. The policies of the Coastal   Act constitute the statutory standards applied to planning and regulatory   decisions made by the Commission and by local governments, pursuant to the   Coastal Act.            On land the coastal zone varies in width from several hundred feet in   highly urbanized areas up to five miles in certain rural areas, and offshore   the coastal zone includes a three-mile-wide band of ocean. The coastal zone   established by the Coastal Act does not include San Francisco Bay, where   development is regulated by the San Francisco Bay Conservation and   Development Commission. | 6A               | California Department of Fish and Wildlife                           | Centroid Within   |                                                       |
| Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program                    | fmmp             |        Current farmland classifications and urbanization extent, as of 2018, for the   State of California. Data provided by the California Department of   Conservation Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP). The next,   complete set of updated data will be released sometime in 2020.            Established in 1982, Government Code Section 65570 mandates the FMMP   biennially report on the conversion of farmland and grazing land, and to   provide maps and data to local government and the public. The data is a   current inventory of agricultural resources. This data is for general   planning purposes and has a minimum mapping unit of ten acres.            Feature sets are distributed by the Department of Conservation, who release   updates every two years for the counties updated during that period. Each   decadal release (1990, 2000, and 2010) pulls together the complete set of   updates for the period and released as a complete (for the counties the State   maps) statewide feature set.| 6B               | California Department of Conservation                                | Centroid Within   | polygon_ty = S                                        |
| Wetlands                                                   | wetland          | This feature set represents the   extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in   the San Francisco Bay Region and surround counties. The features were   extracted from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands   Inventory (NWI) state download for California by the Metropolitan   Transportation Commission.            These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as   defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). The National Wetlands Inventory - Version   2, Surface Waters and Wetlands Inventory was derived by retaining the wetland   and deepwater polygons that compose the NWI digital wetlands spatial data   layer and reintroducing any linear wetland or surface water features that   were orphaned from the original NWI hard copy maps by converting them to   narrow polygonal features. Additionally, the data are supplemented with   hydrography data, buffered to become polygonal features, as a secondary   source for any single-line stream features not mapped by the NWI and to   complete segmented connections. Wetland mapping conducted in Washington,   Oregon, California, Nevada and Idaho after 2012 and most other projects   mapped after 2015 were mapped to include all surface water features and are   not derived data. The linear hydrography feature set used to derive Version 2   was the United States Geological Survey's National Hydrography Dataset   (NHD).  Specific information on the NHD   version used to derive Version 2 and where Version 2 was mapped can be found   in the 'comments' field of the Wetlands_Project_Metadata feature class.            Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program   because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used   to detect wetlands.  These habitats   include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the   intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters.  Some deepwater reef communities (coral or   tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory.  These habitats, because of their depth, go   undetected by aerial imagery.                By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of "farmed   wetlands" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not   coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.    Contact the Service's National Wetlands Inventory Program for   additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on   wetland maps. | 6C               |        United   States Fish and Wildlife Service                     | Centroid Within   |                                                       |
| Fire Severity Risk: State and Local   Responsibility Areas | fire_hazard      | This data set represents   Moderate, High, and Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones in State   Responsibility Areas (SRA) and Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones in Local   Responsibility Areas (LRA) for the San Francisco Bay Region and surrounding   counties. The data was assembled by the Metropolitan Transportation   Commission from multiple shapefiles provided by the California Department of   Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). The SRA data was extracted from a   statewide shapefile and the LRA data is a combination of county shapefiles. |        California   Department of Forestry and Fire Protection       | Centroid Within   | haz_class in (High, Very High)                        |
| Hazardous Waste Sites                                      | hazardous_waste  | This dataset represents   hazardous waste sites that are part of the Cortese List. The Hazardous Waste   and Substances Sites List, also known as the Cortese List—named for Dominic   Cortese—or California Superfund, is a planning document used by the State of California   and its various local agencies and developers to comply with the California   Environmental Quality Act requirements in providing information about the   location of hazardous materials release sites. California Government Code   section 65962.5 requires the California Environmental Protection Agency to   develop at least an annually updated Cortese List.            The California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) is responsible   for a portion of the information contained in the Cortese List. Other State   and local government agencies are required to provide additional hazardous   material release information for the Cortese List.            The list is maintained via DTSC's Brownfields and Environmental Restoration   Program (Cleanup Program), called EnviroStor. The database currently contains   575 sites, including the Federal Superfund sites. It also maintains corrected   and partially corrected sites, listed Certified with Operation and   Maintenance sites.| 6E               | California Department of Toxic Substances Control                    | Point In Polygon  |                                                       |
| Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones                      | earthquake       |          This data set   contains the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones and fault traces as shown   on the Official Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones Map. The data set is   comprised of polygons that form regulatory zone boundaries (Alquist-Priolo   Earthquake Fault Zones), lines that show identified fault traces, and label   points and leaderlines for fault trace annotation. These features delineate   areas where surface fault rupture previously has occurred, or where local   topographic, geological, and geotechnical conditions indicate a potential for   permanent ground displacements such that mitigation by avoidance as stated in   Public Resources Code Section 2621.5 would be required.            This data will assist cities and counties in fulfilling their responsibility   to prohibit the location of developments and structures for human occupancy   across the trace of active faults as required by the Alquist-Priolo   Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (Public Resources Code, Division 2, Chapter 7.5,   Sections 2621-2630). Local governments can withhold development permits until   geologic investigations are conducted for specific sites and mitigation   measures are incorporated into development plans. Sellers of property use the   maps to check the location of their specific site and, if applicable,   disclose to the buyer that the property lies within an earthquake fault zone   as required by the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (PRC Section   2621.9).| 6F               | California Department of Conservation - California Geological Survey | Centroid Within   |                                                       |
| FEMA Flood Hazard Zones                                    | flood_hazard     | This flood zone data should not   be used for flood insurance purposes, but rather hazard mapping. Flood   Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) data retrieved directly from the Federal Emergency   Management Agency (FEMA) should be used for insurance programs.            From FEMA:      The FIRM is the basis for floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance   activities for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Insurance   applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the   Flood Disaster Protection Act, which '... requires the purchase of flood   insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by   Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the   acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in   identified areas having special flood hazards,' Section 2 (b) (4) of the   Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973.            In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs),   the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of   premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The FIRM Database   presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format   suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The FIRM Database  serves to archive the information collected   during the Flood Risk Project.            The National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL) data incorporates all FIRM databases   published by the FEMA, and any Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs) that have been   issued against those databases since their publication date. It is updated on   a monthly basis. The FIRM Database is the digital, geospatial version of the   flood hazard information shown on the published paper FIRMs.            The FIRM Database depicts flood risk information and supporting data used   to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the   1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood   event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The FIRM Database is derived from   Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published FIRMs, flood hazard   analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data,   where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by FEMA.            The NFHL is available as State or US Territory data sets. Each State or   Territory data set consists of all FIRM Databases and corresponding LOMRs   available on the publication date of the data set.            The specification for the horizontal control of FIRM Databases is   consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000. This file   is georeferenced to the Earth's surface using the Geographic Coordinate   System (GCS) and North American Dataum of 1983. | 6G;6H            | Federal Emergency Management Agency                                  | Centroid Within   | fld_zone in ('A', 'A99', 'AE', 'AH', 'AO', 'V', 'VE') |
| California Protected Area Database                         | cpad             |        This feature set contains a subset of the statewide California Protected   Areas Database (CPAD). The geographic extent covers the San Francisco Bay   Region and its surrounding counties.            CPAD inventories open space lands that have been protected for open space   uses through fee ownerships. CPAD is not a database of all public lands – for   example, it does not include public buildings, water treatment sites, or   other non-open space public land.            CPAD is suitable for a wide range of planning, assessment, analysis, and   display purposes. CPAD should not be used as the basis for official   regulatory, legal, or other such governmental actions without more detailed   review of current official land records in the area of focus.            This feature set contains the CPAD Super Unit features of the database.   Super Units are aggregations of Units (which themselves are aggregations of   Holdings) to create use-focused polygons for each site name (e.g. Las Trampas   Regional Wilderness).            Super Units are useful for recreation applications and for cartographic   representation.            Note:            Super Units aggregate units based on the managing agency.      Super Units maintain distinct units for different types of public   access.      Super Units cross county boundaries.      Super Units have fewer attributes and are primarily used for   cartography/display purposes, and to support recreational access   applications.      The lands in CPAD are defined by their owning and managing agencies at the   Holdings and Units levels. At the Super Units level (a version of the release   meant primarily for recreation applications, and for general cartography),   CPAD lands are defined simply by name, managing agency, and public access.| Centroid Within   |                                                       |
| Threatened and Endangered Species   Critical Habitat       | critical_habitat | When a species is proposed for   listing as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act, the   United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) must consider whether there   are areas of habitat believed to be essential the species’ conservation. Those   areas may be proposed for designation as “critical habitat.” Critical habitat   is a term defined and used in the Act. It is a specific geographic area(s)   that contains features essential for the conservation of a threatened or   endangered species and that may require special management and protection.   Critical habitat may include an area that is not currently occupied by the   species but that will be needed for its recovery. An area is designated as   “critical habitat” after the Service publishes a proposed Federal regulation   in the Federal Register and receives and considers public comments on the   proposal. The final boundaries of the critical habitat are also published in   the Federal Register.            Critical habitat are areas considered essential for the conservation of a   listed species. Federal agencies are required to consult with the USFWS on   actions they carry out, fund, or authorize to ensure that their actions will   not destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. These areas provide notice   to the public and land managers of the importance of these areas to the   conservation of a listed species. Special protections and/or restrictions are   possible in areas where Federal funding, permits, licenses, authorizations,   or actions occur or are required. | 6J               | United States Fish and Wildlife   Service                            | Centroid Within   |                                                       |
| California Conservation Easement Database                | cced             | This feature set contains a subset of the statewide California Conservation Easement Database (CCED). The   geographic extent covers the San Francisco Bay Region and its surrounding   counties.            CCED inventories lands that have been protected through conservation or   open space easements. Easements are deed-based restrictions on private land   that limit its uses to those compatible with maintaining it as open   space.  Lands under easement may be   actively farmed/grazed, forested, or held as nature reserves - but they are   usually private lands without any public access.            No Public Access      Almost all lands in CCED should be considered Closed and not open to the   public. Any maps including easement lands must clearly and prominently   indicate that these lands are Closed areas – and any map of recreational or   other public access sites/opportunities must not include easement lands.   Where easement properties are known to allow managed public use, these   opportunities may be shown, but only where they are validated with the   easement holder.            Conservation easements are legal restrictions created by a contract between   a land owner and a qualified agency or organization that are usually based on   limiting the future uses of a property to those compatible with open space,   conservation, farming or other defined uses. Such easements reduce or remove   development opportunities on these lands. All easements in California are   officially filed with the relevant County Recorder’s office (not necessarily   the Assessor’s office) and are public records data. Some easements are   acquired with public funding; others are created by landowner donations, and   many by a combination of the two. Where public funding is involved, public   records describing and mapping the property and presenting its appraisal are   created.            CCED is focused on lands conserved for natural or other open space purposes   and does not include all easements. For example, it does not include utility   easements or easements created for short terms (10 or fewer years).            CCED easement lands range from the very small parcels in cities to large   rural or wild landscapes. Uses on these parcels may include farming, ranching,   timber harvesting or open space (including use as floodways, scenic viewsheds   or for the protection of biodiversity). Easement protected lands are   sometimes parts of larger protected landscapes and sometimes they exist on   their own. It is important to note that one privately owned property may have   two or more easements held by agencies or nonprofits (“stacked” easements) –   this can affect statistical counts of easement acres.            Starting with the 2021a release, CCED includes additional details about the   Gap Analysis Project (GAP) status of easements. GAP codes are a United States   Geological Survey (USGS)-defined metric that reflects management intent (USGS   2020, Prior-McGee 1998). GAP codes are categorized on a scale from 1 to 4 where   GAP 1 and 2 are areas primarily managed with the intent to protect   biodiversity, GAP 3 are areas managed for multiple uses including   conservation, recreation, and extraction and GAP 4 has no known mandate for   biodiversity protection. Data for GAP codes in CCED is sourced from Protected   Areas Database-United States (PADUS) and National Conservation Easement   Database (NCED). As additional data about GAP codes becomes available we will   aim to update and improve this field in CCED. | 6K               | GreenInfo Network                                                    | Centroid Within   |                                                       |
| National Register of Historic Places                       | historic_place   | The National Park Service   Cultural Resources GIS program has created spatial data from the unrestricted   National Register of Historic Places database (NRIS) inventory in a file   geodatabase format using ESRI’s ArcMap 10.0. The data model is structured in compliance   with NPS Cultural Resources Spatial Data Transfer Standards. More detail on   the model and these standards can be found here:   https://www.nps.gov/crgis/crgis_standards_overview.htm            Use of this information in meeting a federal agency’s responsibilities   under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act does not in   itself constitute compliance with Section 106, which requires agencies to   consult with the appropriate State and/or Tribal Preservation Offices in the   identification and evaluation of historic properties.            Users should be aware that many points and polygon boundaries require some   level of correction. In general, this dataset contains modest corrections to   the coordinates contained in the NRIS with reference to some of the point   data. In many cases, polygon boundaries may appear incorrect due to minor   errors in the database. It is our intent to be able to address these errors   and improve the quality of the spatial data over time.            This dataset represents the contents of the available coordinates for   unrestricted National Register properties. A schedule of updates will be   posted in the near future.| 7C               | National Parks Service                                               | Point In Polygon  |                                                       |

7. The development is not located on a site where any of the following apply:

	A. The development would require the demolition of the following types of housing:

		
	~i. Housing that is subject to a recorded covenant, ordinance, or law that restricts rents to levels affordable to persons and families of moderate, low, or very low income.~

	~ii. Housing that is subject to any form of rent or price control through a public entity’s valid exercise of its police power.~

	~iii. Housing that has been occupied by tenants within the past 10 years.~
		
	~B. The site was previously used for housing that was occupied by tenants that was demolished within 10 years before the development proponent submits an application under this section.~

	C. The development would require the demolition of a historic structure that was placed on a national, state, or local historic register.

	~D. The property contains housing units that are occupied by tenants, and units at the property are, or were, subsequently offered for sale to the general public by the subdivider or subsequent owner of the property.~

## Methodology

The SB9 Elligible Parcels dataset was developed in Python Jupyter Notebooks, using primarily the Pandas/Geopandas libraries. Below is a quick description of the methodology followed to create the final dataset. 

1. Create an inventory of all datasets used to conduct the analysis. The inventory is listed above. [See Data Sources](#data-sources)
2. Pre-process datasets. Datasets underwent spatial processing to clip features to the boundaries of the 9-County Bay Area or were filtered. See processing_filtering column in the [Data Sources](#data-sources) table above for a quick review of operations. For a more detailed look at the processing, review the Jupyter Notebook.

3. Run spatial overlay process. Centroids on the surface of parcel polygons were generated. These parcels were then spatially joined with excusion areas flagging whether or not they were within exlusion areas. For point-based exclusion site data, points were joined to polygons to flag whether an exclusion site was within a polygon. For a more detailed look at the overlay analysis, reviw the Jupyter Notebook.
