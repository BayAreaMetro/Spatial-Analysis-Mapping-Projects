    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Load Data and Libraries\n",
    "1. Set up environment and load necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, geopandas, gtfs_kit)\n",
    "2. Load GTFS data using gtfs_kit and convert to GeoDataFrame for spatial analysis\n",
    "3. Load pedestrian access point data and transit station data as GeoDataFrames\n",
    "4. Load Caltrans High Quality Transit Stops (HQTS) data as GeoDataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare Data for Analysis\n",
    "1. Enrich GTFS stops with route and agency information by merging with routes and agency tables; aggregate to get lists of routes and agencies serving each stop\n",
    "2. Filter GTFS stops to include only those served by relevant transit agencies (e.g., BART, Caltrain, AC Transit, SFMTA, VTA)\n",
    "3. Separate stations and stops based on GTFS hierarchy based on location_type and parent_station fields (see [GTFS documentation](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#stopstxt) for details)\n",
    "4. Filter Caltrans High Quality Station Stops to include only those with `HQTA Type == major_stop_brt` \n",
    "\n",
    "Flag Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Stops\n",
    "1. Flag GTFS stops as TOD applicable if they are either:\n",
    "   1. A stop that meets the Caltrans definition of a major BRT stop (i.e., in the filtered Caltrans dataset) using a list of `stop_id`s from the filtered HQTS dataset, OR\n",
    "   2. A stop with `route_type in [0 (Tram, Streetcar, Light rail), 1 (Subway, Metro)]` (see [GTFS documentation](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#routestxt) for details) or `agency_id == 'CT' (Caltrain)` \n",
    "      1. Exceptions: Exclude stops South of Tamien Station on the Caltrain System, and BART stops within Contra Costa County. \n",
    "2. Create Transit Tier classification:\n",
    "   1. Tier 1: `route_type == 1 (Subway, Metro)` or `agency_id == 'CT' (Caltrain)`\n",
    "   2. Tier 2: `route_type == 0 (Tram, Streetcar, Light rail)` or a stop that meets the Caltrans definition of a major BRT stop (i.e., in the filtered Caltrans dataset) using a list of `stop_id`s from the filtered HQTS dataset.\n",
    "3. Create a final filtered GeoDataFrame of TOD applicable stops, including relevant attributes such as stop_id, stop_name, parent_station, agency_name, route_short_name, and geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Associate Parent Stations with TOD Stops & Access Points\n",
    "1.  Manually create stations for stops that are flagged as TOD applicable, such as SFMTA light rail stops not co-located with a BART Station (e.g. Van Ness, Church, Forest Hill, Yerba Buena/Moscone, etc.), VTA light rail stops, and BRT stops. \n",
    "2.  Manually create pedestrian access points for stops that are flagged as TOD applicable following the same process as above (add guidance from HCD on what constitutes a pedestrian access point, e.g. crosswalks, sidewalks, etc.).\n",
    "3.  Associate stops and access points with parent stations. This may be performed by spatially joining stops and access points to stations using a near spatial join with a specified distance threshold (e.g. 200 feet) though manual review and adjustments will likely be necessary to ensure accurate associations, especially in dense urban areas where multiple stations and stops may be in close proximity.\n",

    "Create Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Zones \n",
    "\n",
    "**SB79 TOD Zones – Applicability Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "This table summarizes where Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Zones apply by Transit Tier and Jurisdiction Type. Distances are measured from pedestrian access points and represent distinct distance bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where TOD Zones Apply\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tier       | City with Population > 35,000       | City with Population ≤ 35,000 | Unincorporated Area |\n",

    "\n",
    "Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tier Precedence Rule:\n",
    "   - Where Tier 1 and Tier 2 zones intersect, Tier 1 supersedes Tier 2. Tier 2 geometry must be erased in overlapping areas.\n",
    "2. Geographic Scope:\n",
    "   - Applies only to cities located within:\n",
    "     - Alameda County\n",
    "     - San Francisco County\n",
    "     - San Mateo County\n",
    "     - Santa Clara County\n",
    "3. Distance Bands:\n",
    "   - Bands are distinct (non-cumulative):\n",
    "     - 0–200 feet\n",
    "     - 201–1320 feet (¼ mile ring excluding first 200 feet)\n",
    "     - 1321–2640 feet (½ mile ring excluding first ¼ mile)\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation Steps\n",
    "1. Generate 200 ft, .25 mile, and .5 mile Euclidean (straight-line) buffers around all pedestrian access points by tier\n",
    "2. Intersect buffers with jurisdiction boundaries with associated population data to determine applicable zones based on the matrix above\n",
    "3. Remove .5 mile buffers where jurisdiction population is ≤ 35,000 or in unincorporated areas\n",
    "4. Erase Tier 2 areas where overlapping with Tier 1 buffers to ensure Tier 1 precedence\n",
    "5. Dissolve by Tier and distance band to create final TOD Zone geometries\n",
    "6. Validate and review final TOD Zone geometries for accuracy and consistency with the defined criteria \n",
