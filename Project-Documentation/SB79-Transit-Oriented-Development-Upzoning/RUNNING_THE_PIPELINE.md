# Running the Pipeline

The pipeline is implemented as a sequence of five Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook is self-contained and reads/writes to a shared GeoPackage (`tod_database.gpkg`) defined in `config.py`. There are **two mandatory manual GIS review gates** — one after Step 1 and one between Steps 2 and 3. Do not skip them.

## Prerequisites

- Python environment with `geopandas`, `pandas`, `gtfs_kit`, `shapely`, `uuid`, and `openpyxl` installed
- Access to the MTC Box folder containing source data (see [Source Data](README.md#source-data))
- Paths in `config.py` updated to match your local data directory
- QGIS (or equivalent) for the manual GIS review gate after Step 1
- Excel (or equivalent spreadsheet application) for the manual review gate between Steps 2 and 3

## Step 1 – GTFS TOD Stop Classification

**Notebook:** `1_gtfs_tod_stop_classification.ipynb`

Loads the regional GTFS feed and Caltrans High Quality Transit Stops (HQTS) data, classifies each stop as TOD-eligible (Tier 1 or Tier 2), and writes the results to the shared GeoPackage.

**Outputs written to GPKG:**
- `stops` — GTFS location_type=0 stop/platform records served by relevant routes, with `tod_stop` flag and `tod_tier` classification
- `stations` — GTFS location_type=1 parent station records
- `access_points` — GTFS location_type=2 (entrance/exit) and location_type=3 (generic node) records

> **Manual GIS review required before running Step 2.**
>
> The `stops`, `stations`, and `access_points` layers from the GPKG serve as the starting point for manual curation. Curated output is saved to a File Geodatabase (`tod_database.gdb`), which Step 2 reads directly via the layer names defined in `config.py`.
>
> **Stations:**
> 1. Load the `stations` layer from the GPKG into GIS.
> 2. Copy it into `tod_database.gdb` as the layer defined by `GDB_STATIONS_LAYER` in `config.py`.
> 3. Manually add station records for TOD-applicable stops that lack a parent station in GTFS — for example, SFMTA light rail stops not co-located with a BART station, VTA light rail stops, and BRT stops.
>
> **Stops:**
> 1. Load the `stops` layer from the GPKG into GIS.
> 2. Copy it into `tod_database.gdb` as the layer defined by `GDB_STOPS_LAYER` in `config.py`.
> 3. Review each stop flagged as `tod_stop = 1` by the automated process to confirm correctness.
> 4. For any stops that should be TOD-applicable but were not caught by the automated logic, manually set `tod_stop = 1` and populate the `action` column with the reason for inclusion (e.g. `"manual — VTA BRT stop"`, `"manual — SFMTA light rail"`).
> 5. Manually add stops that did not exist in the GTFS source data, such as planned stops identified in the Regional Transportation Improvement Plan (RTIP) and update required columns such as `tod_stop`, `stop_id`, `stop_name`, `agency_id`, `agency_name`, and `location_type`.
>
> **Access Points:**
> 1. Load the `access_points` layer from the GPKG into GIS — this is the GTFS-derived baseline for the current feed.
> 2. Compare against the existing layer defined by `GDB_ACCESS_PTS_LAYER` in `config.py`. Since manually-added access points from prior rounds may not appear in the current GTFS feed, carry forward any records from the existing GDB layer that are not represented in the new GPKG output.
> 3. Add new access points identified in the GTFS output; remove any that are no longer applicable.
> 4. Save the reconciled layer to `tod_database.gdb` under the layer name defined by `GDB_ACCESS_PTS_LAYER` in `config.py`.
>
> Once all three curated layers are saved to `tod_database.gdb`, proceed to Step 2.

## Step 2 – TOD Stop and Access Point Assignment

**Notebook:** `2_tod_stop_and_access_assignment.ipynb`

Loads the curated stations, stops, and pedestrian access points from the project File Geodatabase (layers defined by `GDB_STATIONS_LAYER`, `GDB_STOPS_LAYER`, and `GDB_ACCESS_PTS_LAYER` in `config.py`), joins GTFS-authoritative `station_id` values, then spatially assigns each TOD stop and access point to a parent station by progressively expanding station buffers at **150 ft, 300 ft, 500 ft, and 1000 ft** (EPSG:26910). Points falling within exactly one station buffer are assigned; points intersecting multiple station buffers at the same distance are flagged as conflicts. Non-TOD stations are excluded before spatial assignment using the station overrides list (`YYYY_MM_DD_tod_stations_overrides.xlsx`). Outputs development layers to the shared GeoPackage and a review Excel workbook for manual resolution.

**Outputs written to GPKG** *(development layers):*
- `tod_stations_dev` — station layer used for spatial assignment (filtered to TOD stations)
- `tod_stops_dev` — TOD stops with spatially assigned `station_id` and `assignment_status`
- `tod_access_points_dev` — merged access points with spatially assigned `station_id` and `assignment_status`

**Review workbook written to Box data folder:**
- `SB79_tod_review.xlsx` — contains all stops and access points with `assignment_status` and `station_id`; reviewers use this file to resolve conflicts and no-match records before running Step 3

> **Manual Excel review required before running Step 3.**
>
> 1. **Before editing — rename the file.** Rename `SB79_tod_review.xlsx` to `SB79_tod_review_reviewed_YYYY_MM_DD.xlsx` (replacing `YYYY_MM_DD` with today's date). This prevents a future re-run of Step 2 from overwriting your work. Then update `REVIEW_XLSX` in `config.py` to point to the renamed file path.
> 2. **Priority — resolve `conflict` and `no_match` records first.**
>    - Filter each sheet to rows where `assignment_status` is `conflict` or `no_match`.
>    - Open the corresponding `_dev` layer (`tod_stops_dev` or `tod_access_points_dev`) in QGIS/ArcGIS Pro alongside `tod_stations_dev` to visually identify the correct parent station.
>    - Copy the correct `station_id` from `tod_stations_dev` into the `station_id` cell for that row.
>    - Set `assignment_status` = `manual_station_assignment` using the dropdown.
> 3. **Secondary — correct any mis-assigned records.**
>    - If a row has `assignment_status = assigned` but the spatial assignment produced the wrong station (e.g., a stop was snapped to the nearest station rather than its true parent), update `station_id` to the correct value and set `assignment_status` = `manual_station_assignment`.
>    - Leave correctly-assigned rows untouched — only rows with `assignment_status = manual_station_assignment` are applied as updates in Step 3.
> 4. Save the workbook, then run Step 3.

## Step 2b – Review Reconciliation

**Notebook:** `2b_tod_review_reconciliation.ipynb`

Run **only** when Step 2 has been re-run after new stops or access points were added, making the existing reviewed workbook stale. Reconciles the fresh `SB79_tod_review.xlsx` with the previously-reviewed workbook (`REVIEW_XLSX` in `config.py`) to carry forward valid `manual_station_assignment` decisions, then writes a new dated workbook as the starting point for the next manual review cycle.

**Carry-over rules:**
- Only rows with `assignment_status = manual_station_assignment` are carried from the stale workbook — `conflict` and `no_match` rows are discarded in favour of the fresh spatial assignment.
- Carried-over `station_id` values that no longer exist in the current TOD station universe are downgraded to `conflict` and flagged for re-review.
- Records dropped from the new ID universe (present in the stale workbook but absent from the fresh Step 2 output) are reported in the notebook output but not written to the reconciled workbook.

**Inputs (set in `config.py`):**
- `REVIEW_XLSX_OUTPUT` (`SB79_tod_review.xlsx`) — fresh Step 2 output; authoritative ID universe
- `REVIEW_XLSX` (`SB79_tod_review_reviewed_YYYY_MM_DD.xlsx`) — stale reviewed workbook with prior manual overrides
- `GPKG_TOD_STATIONS_DEV_LAYER` — used to validate carried-over `station_id` values

**Output written to Box data folder:**
- `SB79_tod_review_YYYY_MM_DD.xlsx` — reconciled workbook with today's date; ready for manual review

> **After running this notebook:**
>
> 1. Update `REVIEW_XLSX` in `config.py` to point to the new dated output file.
> 2. Open the file and resolve any remaining `conflict` or `no_match` rows (same process as after Step 2).
> 3. Save the workbook, then run Step 3.

## Step 3 – Station Assignment Reintegration

**Notebook:** `3_tod_station_assignment_reintegration.ipynb`

Reads the manually-reviewed Excel workbook (path set via `REVIEW_XLSX` in `config.py`), validates any manually-assigned `station_id` values against the TOD station universe, applies corrections to the development datasets, and exports the final authoritative layers to the shared GeoPackage.

**Inputs:**
- Reviewed workbook (path set via `REVIEW_XLSX` in `config.py`) — the renamed `SB79_tod_review_reviewed_YYYY_MM_DD.xlsx` file with `manual_station_assignment` rows filled in
- `tod_stations_dev`, `tod_stops_dev`, `tod_access_points_dev` — development layers from Step 2 (read from GPKG)

**Outputs written to GPKG** *(final authoritative layers):*
- `tod_stations` — final station layer (see [Pipeline Outputs](README.md#pipeline-outputs))
- `tod_stops` — final stops with all manual corrections applied (see [Pipeline Outputs](README.md#pipeline-outputs))
- `tod_access_points` — final access points with all manual corrections applied (see [Pipeline Outputs](README.md#pipeline-outputs))

> No manual review required between Steps 3 and 4.

## Step 4 – TOD Zone Buffer Generation

**Notebook:** `4_tod_zone_buffer_generation.ipynb`

Loads the finalized `tod_access_points` layer from the shared GeoPackage and generates the SB79 TOD zone geography through four main stages:

1. **Buffer generation** — creates full-circle Euclidean buffers at 200 ft, ¼ mile, and ½ mile around each access point, tagged with `tod_tier` and `buffer_band`.
2. **Jurisdictional population rule** — erases all buffers (200 ft, ¼ mile, ½ mile) within unincorporated county lands; additionally erases half-mile buffers within incorporated cities with total population < 35,000.
3. **Geographic priority resolution** — applies a sequential erase to produce six non-overlapping zone layers labeled by `zone_label`. See [Geographic Prioritization Approach](README.md#geographic-prioritization-approach) in Development Notes.
4. **Finalization** — dissolves by `zone_label` and explodes to single-part polygons, producing a dataset with uniform geometry types throughout.

**Inputs:**
- `tod_access_points` — finalized pedestrian access points (from Step 3)
- `tod_stations` — finalized TOD stations (from Step 3)
- `tod_stops` — finalized TOD stops (from Step 3)
- Bay Area jurisdiction boundaries with ACS 2019–2023 5-year population estimates (loaded from ArcGIS REST service)

**Outputs written to GPKG:**
- `tod_zone_buffers` — full-circle per-access-point buffers at all three distance bands; diagnostic/QA layer (see [Pipeline Outputs](README.md#pipeline-outputs))
- `jurisdictions_with_pop_acs2019_2023` — jurisdiction boundaries with ACS 2019–2023 population attributes
- `tod_zones` — authoritative SB79 TOD zone polygons, post-priority resolution (see [Pipeline Outputs](README.md#pipeline-outputs))
