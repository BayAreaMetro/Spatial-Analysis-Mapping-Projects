## About the Dataset

Senate Bill 79 (SB79) requires Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to identify and map Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Zones based on proximity to qualifying transit stops.

This project develops a reproducible geospatial methodology to:

- Identify SB79-eligible transit stops (Tier 1 and Tier 2)
- Define pedestrian access points and stations associated with those stops
- Generate distinct TOD zones based on Euclidean distance bands around access points
- Apply jurisdictional population rules
- Produce a policy-compliant TOD zone layer for the Bay Area

The resulting datasets will serve as the authoritative SB79 TOD geography for Alameda, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties.

**Project Scope:**
- **Data Collection** -- Gather GTFS feeds, Caltrans HQTS data, jurisdiction boundaries, and transit station datasets.
- **Data Preparation / Modeling** -- Identify TOD-eligible stops, classify tiers, construct pedestrian access points, and generate TOD bands.
- **Data Ingestion** -- Prepare final geospatial layer for internal review and publication.
- **Data Catalog / Publishing / MDM** -- Document methodology, inventory dataset in MDM Catalog, add to Enterprise Database, and publish to DAAS platforms (e.g. ArcGIS Online, Open Data, Socrata.)

## Background and Policy Context

SB 79, the *Abundant and Affordable Homes Near Transit Act*, was signed into law on October 10, 2025 and is codified in Government Code §§ 65912.155–65912.162. The law makes qualified housing development an allowed use on residential, mixed-use, and commercial sites near high-quality transit stops in counties with more than 15 passenger rail stations. In the Bay Area, eligible counties are Alameda, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara.

SB 79 establishes minimum standards for building height, density, and residential floor area ratio (FAR) that vary by distance from a transit stop and the classification of that stop. It also requires each metropolitan planning organization (MPO) to produce a tiered map of TOD stops and zones. That map carries a rebuttable presumption of validity for use by project applicants and local governments.

### TOD stop tiers

Each qualifying transit stop is assigned one of two tiers based on service type:

- **Tier 1** — served by heavy rail transit or very high-frequency commuter rail (at least 72 trains/day across both directions). In the Bay Area: BART stations in Alameda, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara Counties, and qualifying Caltrain stations (Tamien Station through the future Salesforce Transit Center, excluding stations with no daily service).
- **Tier 2** — served by light rail transit, high-frequency commuter rail (at least 48 trains/day), or bus rapid transit. In the Bay Area: VTA light rail, SF Muni Metro and Streetcar, AC Transit Tempo, and select additional stops.

### Pedestrian access points

Buffer distances under SB 79 are measured as a straight line from the nearest edge of a parcel to a pedestrian access point for the TOD stop — not from a single station centroid. While "pedestrian access point" is not defined in the statute, guidance communicated by the bill author's office to HCD establishes the following hierarchy:

- Where an entrance exists: the station entrance
- Where no entrance exists: the platform edges
- Where neither exists: a single point

### Development standards

SB 79 sets the following minimum development standards by tier and distance from a TOD stop. Local agencies may not apply lower height, density, or residential FAR limits than those listed below.

| Distance from TOD stop | Tier 1 height | Tier 1 density | Tier 1 FAR | Tier 2 height | Tier 2 density | Tier 2 FAR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Adjacent (≤ 200 ft) | 95 ft | 160 du/ac | 4.5 | 85 ft | 140 du/ac | 4.0 |
| ≤ ¼ mile | 75 ft | 120 du/ac | 3.5 | 65 ft | 100 du/ac | 3.0 |
| ¼–½ mile (cities ≥ 35,000 residents) | 65 ft | 100 du/ac | 3.0 | 55 ft | 80 du/ac | 2.5 |

## Expected Fields

This process will generate four interrelated datasets:

### SB79 Transit-Oriented Development Zones
Final policy-compliant TOD zone polygons with tier classifications and distance bands.

*Field specifications to be documented during development.*

### Stations 
Parent transit station locations (location_type = 1 in GTFS hierarchy).

*Field specifications to be documented during development.*

### Stops
Individual transit stop/platform locations actively served by transit routes.

*Field specifications to be documented during development.*

### Access Points
Pedestrian access locations for each transit station used as the basis for TOD zone generation.

*Field specifications to be documented during development.*

## Running the Pipeline

The pipeline is implemented as a sequence of four Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook is self-contained and reads/writes to a shared GeoPackage (`tod_database.gpkg`) defined in `config.py`. There are **two mandatory manual GIS review gates** — one after Step 1 and one between Steps 2 and 3. Do not skip them.

### Prerequisites

- Python environment with `geopandas`, `pandas`, `gtfs_kit`, `shapely`, `uuid`, and `openpyxl` installed
- Access to the MTC Box folder containing source data (see [Resources](#resources))
- Paths in `config.py` updated to match your local data directory
- QGIS (or equivalent) for the manual GIS review gate after Step 1
- Excel (or equivalent spreadsheet application) for the manual review gate between Steps 2 and 3

---

### Step 1 – GTFS TOD Stop Classification

**Notebook:** `1_gtfs_tod_stop_classification.ipynb`

Loads the regional GTFS feed and Caltrans High Quality Transit Stops (HQTS) data, classifies each stop as TOD-eligible (Tier 1 or Tier 2), and writes the results to the shared GeoPackage.

**Outputs written to GPKG:**
- `stops` — GTFS location_type=0 stop/platform records served by relevant routes, with `tod_stop` flag and `tod_tier` classification
- `stations` — GTFS location_type=1 parent station records
- `access_points` — GTFS location_type=2 (entrance/exit) and location_type=3 (generic node) records

> **Manual GIS review required before running Step 2.**
>
> The `stops` and `stations` layers from the GPKG serve as the starting point for manual curation. Curated output is saved to a File Geodatabase (`tod_database.gdb`, layers `stations_v1` and `stops_v1`), which Step 2 reads directly. Pedestrian access points are **not** carried through the FGDB — they are loaded directly from per-agency source files in Step 2.
>
> **Stations (`stations_v1`):**
> 1. Load the `stations` layer from the GPKG into GIS.
> 2. Copy it into `tod_database.gdb` as `stations_v1`.
> 3. Manually add station records for TOD-applicable stops that lack a parent station in GTFS — for example, SFMTA light rail stops not co-located with a BART station, VTA light rail stops, and BRT stops.
>
> **Stops (`stops_v1`):**
> 1. Load the `stops` layer from the GPKG into GIS.
> 2. Copy it into `tod_database.gdb` as `stops_v1`.
> 3. Review each stop flagged as `tod_stop = 1` by the automated process to confirm correctness.
> 4. For any stops that should be TOD-applicable but were not caught by the automated logic, manually set `tod_stop = 1` and populate the `action` column with the reason for inclusion (e.g. `"manual — VTA BRT stop"`, `"manual — SFMTA light rail"`).
>
> Once both curated layers are saved to `tod_database.gdb`, proceed to Step 2.

---

### Step 2 – TOD Stop and Access Point Assignment

**Notebook:** `2_tod_stop_and_access_assignment.ipynb`

Loads per-agency pedestrian access point datasets, normalizes and merges them into a single GeoDataFrame, joins GTFS-authoritative `station_id` values, then spatially assigns each TOD stop and access point to a parent station by progressively expanding station buffers at **150 ft, 300 ft, 500 ft, and 1000 ft** (EPSG:26910). Points falling within exactly one station buffer are assigned; points intersecting multiple station buffers at the same distance are flagged as conflicts. Non-TOD stations are excluded before spatial assignment using the station overrides list (`2026_03_04_tod_stations_overrides.xlsx`). Outputs development layers to the shared GeoPackage and a review Excel workbook for manual resolution.

**Access point sources (loaded and normalized in order):**
- `BA` — BART (`BART_PedAccessPoints_GTFS_v1.zip`)
- `CT` — Caltrain (`Caltrain_PedAccessPoints_GTFS_v3.zip`)
- `AC` — AC Transit (`AC_Transit_PedAcessPoints_v3.gdb`)
- `SC` — VTA (`VTA_PedAccessPoints_GTFS_v2.zip`)
- `SF` — SFMTA (`SFMuni_PedAccessPoints_GTFS_v1.zip`)

**Outputs written to GPKG** *(development layers — not yet authoritative):*
- `tod_stations_dev` — station layer used for spatial assignment (filtered to TOD stations)
- `tod_stops_dev` — TOD stops with spatially assigned `station_id` and `assignment_status`
- `tod_access_points_dev` — merged access points with spatially assigned `station_id` and `assignment_status`

**Review workbook written to Box data folder:**
- `SB79_tod_review.xlsx` — contains all stops and access points with `assignment_status` and `station_id`; reviewers use this file to resolve conflicts and no-match records before running Step 3

> **Manual Excel review required before running Step 3.**
>
> 1. **Before editing — rename the file.** Rename `SB79_tod_review.xlsx` to `SB79_tod_review_reviewed_YYYY_MM_DD.xlsx` (replacing `YYYY_MM_DD` with today's date). This prevents a future re-run of Step 2 from overwriting your work. Then update `REVIEW_XLSX` in `config.py` to point to the renamed file path.
> 2. **Priority — resolve `conflict` and `no_match` records first.**
>    - Filter each sheet to rows where `assignment_status` is `conflict` or `no_match`.
>    - Open the corresponding `_dev` layer (`tod_stops_dev` or `tod_access_points_dev`) in QGIS/ArcGIS Pro alongside `tod_stations_dev` to visually identify the correct parent station.
>    - Copy the correct `station_id` from `tod_stations_dev` into the `station_id` cell for that row.
>    - Set `assignment_status` = `manual_station_assignment` using the dropdown.
> 3. **Secondary — correct any mis-assigned records.**
>    - If a row has `assignment_status = assigned` but the spatial assignment produced the wrong station (e.g., a stop was snapped to the nearest station rather than its true parent), update `station_id` to the correct value and set `assignment_status` = `manual_station_assignment`.
>    - Leave correctly-assigned rows untouched — only rows with `assignment_status = manual_station_assignment` are applied as updates in Step 3.
> 4. Save the workbook, then run Step 3.

---

### Step 3 – Station Assignment Reintegration

**Notebook:** `3_tod_station_assignment_reintegration.ipynb`

Reads the manually-reviewed Excel workbook (path set via `REVIEW_XLSX` in `config.py`), validates any manually-assigned `station_id` values against the TOD station universe, applies corrections to the development datasets, and exports the final authoritative layers to the shared GeoPackage.

**Inputs:**
- Reviewed workbook (path set via `REVIEW_XLSX` in `config.py`) — the renamed `SB79_tod_review_reviewed_YYYY_MM_DD.xlsx` file with `manual_station_assignment` rows filled in
- `tod_stations_dev`, `tod_stops_dev`, `tod_access_points_dev` — development layers from Step 2 (read from GPKG)

**Outputs written to GPKG** *(final authoritative layers):*
- `tod_stations` — final station layer
- `tod_stops` — final stops with all manual corrections applied
- `tod_access_points` — final access points with all manual corrections applied

> No manual review required between Steps 3 and 4.

---

### Step 4 – TOD Zone Buffer Generation

**Notebook:** `4_tod_zone_buffers.ipynb` *(planned)*

Generates 200 ft, ¼ mile, and ½ mile Euclidean buffer zones around finalized access points, applies the policy matrix (tier precedence, jurisdictional population rules, geographic scope), and produces the final SB79 TOD Zone polygons.

**Outputs written to GPKG:**
- `tod_zones` — final SB79 TOD Zone polygons with tier and distance-band attributes

## Process Overview

> This section describes the conceptual methodology behind the pipeline. For step-by-step execution instructions, see [Running the Pipeline](#running-the-pipeline).

### Manual Data Preparation
1. Manually create stations for stops that will be flagged as TOD applicable, such as SFMTA light rail stops not co-located with a BART Station (e.g. Van Ness, Church, Forest Hill, Yerba Buena/Moscone, etc.), VTA light rail stops, and BRT stops.
2. Manually create pedestrian access points for stops that will be flagged as TOD applicable following the same process as above (add guidance from HCD on what constitutes a pedestrian access point, e.g. crosswalks, sidewalks, etc.).

### Load Data and Libraries
1. Set up environment and load necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, geopandas, gtfs_kit)
2. Load GTFS data using gtfs_kit and convert to GeoDataFrame for spatial analysis
3. Load pedestrian access point data and transit station data as GeoDataFrames
4. Load Caltrans High Quality Transit Stops (HQTS) data as GeoDataFrame

### Prepare Data for Analysis
1. Enrich GTFS stops with route and agency information by merging with routes and agency tables; aggregate to get lists of routes and agencies serving each stop
2. Filter GTFS stops to include only those served by relevant transit agencies (e.g., BART, Caltrain, AC Transit, SFMTA, VTA)
3. Separate stations and stops based on GTFS hierarchy based on location_type and parent_station fields (see [GTFS documentation](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#stopstxt) for details)
4. Filter Caltrans High Quality Station Stops to include only those with `HQTA Type == major_stop_brt`

### Flag Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Stops
1. Flag GTFS stops as TOD applicable if they are either:
   1. A stop that meets the Caltrans definition of a major BRT stop (i.e., in the filtered Caltrans dataset) using a list of `stop_id`s from the filtered HQTS dataset, OR
   2. A stop with `route_type in [0 (Tram, Streetcar, Light rail), 1 (Subway, Metro)]` (see [GTFS documentation](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#routestxt) for details) or `agency_id == 'CT' (Caltrain)`
      1. Exceptions: Exclude stops South of Tamien Station on the Caltrain System, and BART stops within Contra Costa County.
2. Create Transit Tier classification:
   1. Tier 1: `route_type == 1 (Subway, Metro)` or `agency_id == 'CT' (Caltrain)`
   2. Tier 2: `route_type == 0 (Tram, Streetcar, Light rail)` or a stop that meets the Caltrans definition of a major BRT stop (i.e., in the filtered Caltrans dataset) using a list of `stop_id`s from the filtered HQTS dataset.
3. Create a final filtered GeoDataFrame of TOD applicable stops, including relevant attributes such as stop_id, stop_name, parent_station, agency_name, route_short_name, and geometry.

### Associate Parent Stations with TOD Stops & Access Points
1. Associate stops and access points with parent stations. This may be performed by spatially joining stops and access points to stations using a near spatial join with a specified distance threshold (e.g. 200 feet) though manual review and adjustments will likely be necessary to ensure accurate associations, especially in dense urban areas where multiple stations and stops may be in close proximity.

### Create Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Zones
1. Generate 200 ft, .25 mile, and .5 mile Euclidean (straight-line) buffers around all pedestrian access points by tier
2. Intersect buffers with jurisdiction boundaries with associated population data to determine applicable zones based on the policy matrix
3. Remove .5 mile buffers where jurisdiction population is ≤ 35,000 or in unincorporated areas
4. Erase Tier 2 areas where overlapping with Tier 1 buffers to ensure Tier 1 precedence
5. Dissolve by Tier and distance band to create final TOD Zone geometries
6. Validate and review final TOD Zone geometries for accuracy and consistency with the defined criteria

## Development Notes

### SB79 TOD Zones – Policy Applicability Matrix

This table summarizes where Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Zones apply by Transit Tier and Jurisdiction Type. Distances are measured from pedestrian access points and represent distinct distance bands.

**Where TOD Zones Apply**

| Tier       | City with Population > 35,000       | City with Population ≤ 35,000 | Unincorporated Area |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Tier 1** | 0–200'<br>201'–1320'<br>1321'–2640' | 0–200'<br>201'–1320'          | Not Applicable      |
| **Tier 2** | 0–200'<br>201'–1320'<br>1321'–2640' | 0–200'<br>201'–1320'          | Not Applicable      |

**Policy Constraints**

1. **Tier Precedence Rule:**
   - Where Tier 1 and Tier 2 zones intersect, Tier 1 supersedes Tier 2. Tier 2 geometry must be erased in overlapping areas. The one exception is where a Tier 2 200 ft zone overlaps with a Tier 1 quarter-mile or half-mile zone — in that case Tier 2 200 ft prevails, as it carries higher development standards than either Tier 1 distance band.
2. **Geographic Scope:**
   - Applies only to cities located within:
     - Alameda County
     - San Francisco County
     - San Mateo County
     - Santa Clara County
3. **Distance Bands:**
   - Bands are distinct (non-cumulative):
     - 0–200 feet
     - 201–1320 feet (¼ mile ring excluding first 200 feet)
     - 1321–2640 feet (½ mile ring excluding first ¼ mile)

### TOD Zone Geographic Prioritization

Where buffers from different tiers and distance bands overlap after union, each geometry is assigned a single TOD zone classification representing the most permissive applicable development standard under SB 79. The prioritization cascades as follows:

| Priority | Zone | Height limit | Density (du/ac) | Residential FAR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Tier 1 — 200 ft | 95 ft | 160 | 4.5 |
| 2 | Tier 2 — 200 ft | 85 ft | 140 | 4.0 |
| 3 | Tier 1 — Quarter mile | 75 ft | 120 | 3.5 |
| 4 | Tier 2 — Quarter mile | 65 ft | 100 | 3.0 |
| 5 | Tier 1 — Half mile* | 65 ft | 100 | 3.0 |
| 6 | Tier 2 — Half mile* | 55 ft | 80 | 2.5 |

*Half-mile band only applies within jurisdictions with population ≥ 35,000. Does not apply in unincorporated areas.

This ordering reflects two rules operating in combination. First, Tier 1 takes precedence over Tier 2 at the same distance band. Second, Tier 2 200 ft is more permissive than Tier 1 quarter-mile or half-mile, so it prevails in those specific cross-tier overlaps. The result is that Priority 1 always yields the highest entitlements and Priority 6 the lowest — a geometry retains the classification of the highest-priority zone it falls within.

The conditional logic implementing this in the buffer generation step is:

```python
if tier_1_200ft:
    return "Tier 1 - 200 ft"
elif tier_2_200ft:
    return "Tier 2 - 200 ft"
elif tier_1_qtr_mile:
    return "Tier 1 - Quarter Mile"
elif tier_2_qtr_mile:
    return "Tier 2 - Quarter Mile"
elif tier_1_half_mile:
    return "Tier 1 - Half Mile"
elif tier_2_half_mile:
    return "Tier 2 - Half Mile"
else:
    return "No TOD Zone"
```

The jurisdiction intersection and removal of half-mile features in sub-35,000 and unincorporated areas is applied as a post-prioritization step, after the union and classification are complete. Polygons are split at jurisdiction boundaries so that each resulting feature falls entirely within a single jurisdiction and population threshold can be evaluated cleanly.

### Technical Considerations

- GTFS data provides the authoritative source for transit stop locations and service patterns. Agency filtering focuses on relevant Bay Area operators: BART (BA), Caltrain (CT), AC Transit (AC), VTA (SC), and SFMTA (SF). Parent-child relationships in the GTFS hierarchy distinguish between stations (`location_type=1`) and individual stops/platforms (`location_type=0`).
- Some stops and access points are not fully represented in GTFS and require manual mapping. This includes SFMTA light rail stops not co-located with a BART station, VTA light rail stops, and BRT stops. Manually mapped features are tracked via the `action` column in the curated stop and station layers.
- Caltrans [High Quality Transit Areas (HQTA) Stops](https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/f6c30480f0e84be699383192c099a6a4_0) data is used to identify TOD-eligible bus stops. Specifically, stops with `hqta_type = major_stop_brt` are used to flag Tier 2 BRT stops based on frequency standards derived from GTFS schedule data. The HQTA dataset is updated monthly by Caltrans — the version acquired for this analysis is recorded in the [Resources](#resources) table. For methodology details see the [Caltrans HQTA documentation](https://docs.calitp.org/data-analyses/high_quality_transit_areas/).
