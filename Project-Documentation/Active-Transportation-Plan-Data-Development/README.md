# Active Transportation Plan Data Development

Update the Regional Bike Network dataset to include facility class, and development status. Create a consolidated, Regional Bike and Pedestrian Facilities dataset, which include all bike and pedestrian facilities collected from the 9-Bay Area Congestion Management Agencies (CMAs) and the 3 largest Bay Area Cities - San Jose, San Francisco, and Oakland.

## Analysis Parameters

### Regional Bikeway Network Classes

- Class I: Off-Street Shared-Use Path - A bikeway physically separated from motorized vehicular traffic by an open space or barrier. Pedestrians, skaters, wheelchair users, joggers, and other non-motorized users typically use shared-use paths.
- Class II: Bike Lane - Portion of the roadway that has been designated by striping, signing and pavement markings for the preferential or exclusive use of bicycles. Some cities and counties also define wide shoulders as bike lanes. Always ride about 4 feet from parked cars to avoid the door zone.
- Class III: On-Street Bike Route - Any road or street designated for bicycle travel. These routes are not for the exclusive use of cyclists. Often, routes include residential streets with low auto volumes and speeds.
- Class IV: Separated Bike Lanes - Separated bike lanes, also known as cycle tracks or protected bike lanes, are a dedicated bikeway that combines the user experience
 of a multi-use path but are located on a street. They are physically distinct from the sidewalk and separated from motor vehicle traffic by a physical object such as parking, a curb, or posts.
