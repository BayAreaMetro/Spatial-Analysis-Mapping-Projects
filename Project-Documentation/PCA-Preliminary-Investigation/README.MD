# PCA Preliminary Investigation

This project is the preliminary investigation of existing Priority Conservation Areas (PCAs) and leads into the larger PCA Refresh project, which will kick off in Summer 2022. This preliminary investigation includes the following: 

1. Evaluates the current PCA polygons and points. 
2. Compares PCAs to other regional geographies, including Officially conserved areas (OCAs), PBA 2050 Growth Geographies and Urban Growth Boundaries, and Hazards (sea level rise and wildfire).
3. Evaluates the Greenprint tool and supporting data within the context of PCAs.          

The goal of this project is to arrive at qualitative, and limited quantitative, questions and findings about the size, distribution, and characteristics of the current PCA framework. This preliminary investigation also explores PCA's relationship to potential future overlay layers and examines the PCA relationship to Greenprint to evaluate the feasibility of using the tool in the refresh process.

## Table of Contents (if needed) 

## Data Sources

List the potential data sources that you think are required to solve the problem. If you are unsure, you can discuss these with the Unit Manager prior to submitting your request for support.

## Analysis Parameters

Analysis parameters are definable, measurable, and can contain a constant or variable characteristic, dimension, property, or value, that is selected from a set of data (or population) because it is considered essential to understanding how to solve a problem. List the parameters that you think are required to solve this problem. Leave this blank if you are unsure of how to determine the analysis parameters for your project. The analyst assigned to the project will document this information.

## Methodology applied to solve problem

The analyst assigned to the project will document this information. The analyst will review the methodology (if applicable) with the project team to ensure that it meets the requirements and expectations of the solution or problem.

## Expected Outcomes (if any)?

Provide your expectations (if any) for the results of this work. Your expectations will form the basis for deciding if the work is complete, or if we need to revisit the problem statement and/or refine the methodology used to solve the problem.

## Results

Determine how close the solution is to the expected outcome. If the solution is acceptable, the work will be considered complete. If the solution is unacceptable, we will need to refine the problem statement or the methodology implemented to find the solution.
