# PCA Preliminary Investigation

This project is the preliminary investigation of existing Priority Conservation Areas (PCAs) and leads into the larger PCA Refresh project, which will kick off in Summer 2022. This preliminary investigation includes the following: 

1. Evaluates the current PCA polygons and points. 
2. Compares PCAs to other regional geographies, including Officially conserved areas (OCAs), PBA 2050 Growth Geographies and Urban Growth Boundaries, and Hazards (sea level rise and wildfire).
3. Evaluates the Greenprint tool and supporting data within the context of PCAs.          

The goal of this project is to arrive at qualitative questions and limited quantitative findings about the size, distribution, and characteristics of the current PCA framework. This preliminary investigation also explores PCA's relationship to potential future overlay layers and examines the PCA relationship to Greenprint to evaluate the feasibility of using the tool in the refresh process.

## Analysis Parameters

### PCA Points and Polygons
- Details about distribution of PCAs, PCA leads, designations, and area by county and as a whole.
- How much of current PCA polygons are overlapping?
### Compare PCAs to Regional Geographies
- How much of PCA area overlaps with OCAs? What types of PCAs overlap with OCAs?
- How much of PCA area overlaps with Growth Geographies and Urban Growth Boundaries? What types of PCAs overlaps with Growth Geographies and Urban Growth Boundaries?
- How much of PCA area overlaps with sea level rise and wildfire hazard areas? What types of PCAs overlap with these hazards?
### Evaluate Greenprint Tool
- How much of the Greenprint rasters overlap with current PCAs? Which values and benefits are best represented by PCAs? Which are not?

## Methodology applied to solve problem

The OCA, growth geographies, urban growth boundaries, and hazard layers were unioned or intersected with the PCA polygons to visualize overlapping areas.
The Greenprint multi-benefit rasters were converted to integer then to polygon and intersected with the PCA polygons to visualize overlapping areas.

## Expected Outcomes (if any)?

The expected outcome of this projects is to have a set of data, findings, and identification of future work that will guide the project team and consultant work on development of the PCA 2.0 Refresh project.

## Results

In progress.
