            <abstract>Roadways (streets and highways) for the San Francisco Bay Region. Feature set was assembled using all roads county-based 2021 TIGER/Line shapefiles by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission.The All Roads shapefiles includes all features within the Census Bureau's Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB) Super Class &amp;quot;Road/Path Features&amp;quot; distinguished where the MAF/TIGER Feature Classification Code for the feature in MTDB that begins with &amp;quot;S&amp;quot;.Â  This includes all primary, secondary, local neighborhood, and rural roads, city streets, vehicular trails (4wd), ramps, service drives, alleys, parking lot roads, private roads for service vehicles (logging, oil fields, ranches, etc.), bike paths or trails, bridle/horse paths, walkways/pedestrian trails, stairways, and winter trails.The feature set contains multiple overlapping road segments where a segment is associated with more than one road feature. For example, if a road segment is associated with US Route 36 and State Highway 7 and 28th Street, the route will contain three spatially coincident segments, each with a different name. The roadway feature set contains the set of unique road segments for each county, along with other linear features.Primary roads are generally divided limited-access highways within the Federal interstate highway system or under state management. Interchanges and ramps distinguish these roads, and some are toll highways.Secondary roads are main arteries, usually in the U.S. highway, state highway, or county highway system. These roads have one or more lanes of traffic in each direction, may or may not be divided, and usually have at-grade intersections with many other roads and driveways. They often have both a local name and a route number.</abstract>
            <purpose>Linear features represent roadways for the San Francisco Bay Region. Feature set was assembled from county shapefiles by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission.</purpose>
