# Spatial-Analysis-Mapping-Projects
This repo provides detailed documentation of work performed by the Data and Visualization team at MTC.  Projects are organized into folder, each containing detailed documentation for the steps and procedures implemented in support of each project.

## Getting Started 
To get started with a spatial analysis or mapping project follow the steps outlined below. 

1. Create a project folder under this folder, providing an appropriate project name using [title case](http://titlecase.com/) formatting separated by a hyphen '-' 
2. Review our [how-to guide](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/dv-project-templates) 
3. Copy and paste markdown text from how-to guide into a new README.md file within your project folder or copy one of the following analysis markdown templates and rename it README.md
   - [ANALYSIS-DETAILED](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/dv-project-templates/blob/master/ANALYSIS-DETAILED.md) 
   - [ANALYSIS-SIMPLE](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/dv-project-templates/blob/master/ANALYSIS-SIMPLE.md)

## Project Table of Contents

> Be sure to update the Table of Contents in this readme.md when adding projects to the repository. Projects should be in alphabetical order. To update markdown text easily, use this [Table Markdown Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) which converts from markdown to an easy-to-use table format. Add a row and description then select generate and replace the markdown code below with updated table.
