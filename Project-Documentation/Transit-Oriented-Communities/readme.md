# Transit Oriented Communities

The Transit Oriented Communities (TOC) policy aims to increase residential and commercial densities in transit-rich areas, prioritizing affordable housing and commercial development in areas near regional transit hubs served by multiple transit providers. The goal of this analysis is to assess the baseline zoning for residential and office/commercial within Priority Development Areas (PDAs) and Transit Rich Areas (TRAs) within 1/2 mile of existing or planned fixed-guideway transit facilities.
