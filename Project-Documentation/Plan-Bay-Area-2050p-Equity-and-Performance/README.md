# Project Title

## Define the Problem Statement

A problem statement is a brief description of the questions to be addressed by the analysis. In addition to describing the initial request, it should provide the context of the work assignment and identify any key stakeholders or major initiatives that relate to the solution. It is used to guide the direction of the effort and will be used to validate that the outcomes of the analysis address the problem statement.

## Project Scope

Identify the scope of the project, and link to additional projects where necessary.

- **Data Collection** (Indicate team members involved)
- **Data Preparation/ Modeling**  (Indicate team members involved)
- **Data Ingestion**  (Indicate team members involved)
- **Data Catalog/ Publishing/ Added to BASIS MDM**  (Indicate team members involved)

## Project Resources

Add links to:
- Activity, Project, or Task on Asana 
- Box directory where any related work products are stored (if applicable) 
- ArcGIS Online Working Group (if applicable) 
- Any other location where important related work products are stored/saved

## Data Sources

List the potential data sources that you think are required to solve the problem. If you are unsure, you can discuss these with the Unit Manager prior to submitting your request for support.

## Analysis Parameters

Analysis parameters are elements from the data as well as additional definitions or features that will be used in your analysis. For example, in a geospatial intersection area analysis, these would be the geometries of the base layer and overlay, and could optionally include a buffer distance or overlay category. Generally, think of analysis parameters as the most important aspects of the data that you are using to answer the questions driving your analysis. If your analysis parameters include definitions, be sure to describe these in your documentation or link to their documentation. For example, if Transit Priority Areas (TPAs) are one of your analysis parameters, give a short description of a TPA and link to the authoritative public resource on TPAs. These repositories have some example Analysis Parameters:

- [Communities of Concern](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/Spatial-Analysis-Mapping-Projects/tree/master/Project-Documentation/Communities-of-Concern)
- [CASA](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/Spatial-Analysis-Mapping-Projects/tree/master/Project-Documentation/CASA)

## Methodology

The analyst assigned to the project will document this information. The analyst will review the methodology (if applicable) with the project team to ensure that it meets the requirements and expectations of the solution or problem.

## Expected Outcomes

Provide your expectations (if any) for the results of this work. Your expectations will form the basis for deciding if the work is complete, or if we need to revisit the problem statement and/or refine the methodology used to solve the problem.

## Results

Determine how close the solution is to the expected outcome. If the solution is acceptable, the work will be considered complete. If the solution is unacceptable, we will need to refine the problem statement or the methodology implemented to find the solution.

## Tags

Add tags to help others find your project, e.g. if you are documenting an analysis done to support Environmental Impact Reporting for Plan Bay Area 2050, add the tags **eir**, **plan bay area 2050**, **environment**.
