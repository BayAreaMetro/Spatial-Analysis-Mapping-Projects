# MTC Data Portal
The [MTC Data Portal](http://portal.mtcanalytics.org/) (Portal) is the main tool staff uses to access resources on the enterprise database. Portal acts as a catalog of all authoritative feature and attribute tables accessible across the section and agency. Using Portal, staff can search for data resources using keywords, list resources by theme, read metadata for each resource, add resources to ArcPro/ArcGIS Desktop, and view features on a map viewer.
