# Documenting Content 

The purpose of this page is to define types of documentation and documentation requirements for each type. Content documentation can be split into two types: **basic documentation** and **detailed documentation**. 

## Basic Documentation 

 - Title: State what it is.  Often times, this will simply be the name of the layer, or association of layers.
     - **Draft Content**
         - Include "draft" in the title: "My Web Map (draft)"
     - **Final Content**
         - Remove "draft" from title: "My Web Map"
 - Summary: A one-line description of the content
 - Description: Additional information that supports summary. 
     - Link to project documentation (if any). 
     - Project or program content was created to support.  
     - Content owner - the person responsible for the project or program the content supports. 
     - Source Files (if available): Link to source files used to generate content. This will generally apply only to static content such as images or pdfs. 
 - Credits (Attribution): Acknowledge the source of the content. (ex. 2015 American Community Survey (ACS); 2012 Federal Highway Administration - Freight Analysis Framework) 
  Tags: Related keywords to support content discovery See: [Content Tagging Strategy](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/file/198480762097)
     - **If content is considered draft include "draft" as a tag**
