## Promoting Content from ArcGIS Online to MTC's Open Data Site
1. Ensure content meets minimum requirements for publishing content to an external audience.
    - [General posting requirements](openDataSite.md)
    - [Metadata requirements](requirements_openDataMetadata.md)
2. If publishing a web layer, ensure coordinate reference system is set to WGS84 (EPSG/SRID: 4326) 
3. Tag with appropriate open data category tag - **Note: if content not tagged, content will not be organized by category on open data site**

   | Open Data Categories |               |          |
   |----------------------|---------------|----------|
   | Administrative       | Demographic   | Policy   |
   | Transportation       | Environmental | Projects |

4. Share resource with Open Data Review group and send and e-mail to msmith@bayareametro.gov letting them know a new resource has been added to the group. If posting the resource to the Open Data site needs to be completed by a specific date, be sure and include that information.

As a reminder, no content will be posted to the MTC Open Data site until it and its metadata have been reviewed and approved for posting. Make sure to include 1-3 days in your production schedule for review if posting is time-sensitive. The more work done upfront to make sure documentation is complete and data properly structured, the more likely time-sensitive postings will occur on time.

The reviewer will contact the person in the content's metadata that was identified as the resource creator regarding any questions or requests for more detail the reviewer has.
